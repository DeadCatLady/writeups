DESCRIPTION: Let's kick things off with one of my favorite classic 
games: Bounce the Flag! Bounce the flag is an immersive hyper-realistic 
gaming experience that involves bouncing a flag on a green rectangle. 
One of Bounce the Flag's most celebrated competitors, Mr. Flag once 
managed a score of 31337 points in a single round. No one knows how he 
did it - not even Mr. Flag himself, because he has amnesia and he 
forgot... He also forgot the password to his account... Maybe you can 
help him out?

Write up: 

The link given takes the user to a website with a game on it. Its a basic game where the user just has to bounce the flag many times. Upon losing the game, the user will be prompted to login with a username and password field. The hint of `bounce_the_flag` includes the objective of hacking into Mr. Flag’s account to get the flag. 

To complete the `bounce_the_flag` challenge, the competitor must open up the inspect element tool, and manually set the score to `1337`, and from there can use an SQL injection in the password section of the form. Typing `Mr. Flag` as the username makes sense for the challenge since the objective is to get into this account. 

In the password field is susceptible to SQL injections, and will return interesting errors as different attempts are made, which leads to a hint about changing the score to `31337`. 

The challenge also provided the code for the challenge. The sql file shows the structure of the database. So, entering `' union select username, password from users --` in the password field will allow the competitor to access Mr.Flag’s account and see the password as `osu{Py7h0n_F_s7r1n9S_4Re_8E4u71FuL_4ND_4M421N9}`.
